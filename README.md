# cocuocr

OCR implementation to read the Corda Cuisine menu and spit it out as JSON.

Inspired by my good friend [Jan Pecquet](https://github.com/pekket)'s [Cocubo](https://github.com/Pekket/Cocubo). Basically just adding the -Script to his Java (going for a 100% JavaScript implementation whereas his is 100% Java).
